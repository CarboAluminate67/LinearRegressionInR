# Overview

In this project I learned an entirely new language: R. I used R to create a linear regression model for data I gathered on rocket engines used around the world. Importing my manually made csv file, I made 3 different linear regression models showing the relationship, or lack thereof, among statistics of the engines such as thrust, efficiency, and fuel type used.

# Development Environment

I used the R language to create these models, written in Visual Studio Code.
The program includes the tidyverse package, which is a collection of libraries, including ggplot2 which is used throughout.

# Future Work

- Improving the graphical side of the models; making it more clean, organized, and with better color palettes. 
- Including further, more directly associated statistics such as chamber pressure
- Adding other kinds of graphs, such as histograms, to compare the performance of the engines against eachother.
